#GOAL
#
# Create a program that prints out every line to the song "99 bottles of beer on the wall." This should be a pretty simple program, so to make it a bit harder, here are some rules to follow.
#
#RULES
#
#If you are going to use a list for all of the numbers, do not manually type them all in. Instead, use a built in function.
#
#Besides the phrase "take one down," you may not type in any numbers/names of numbers directly into your song lyrics.
#
#Remember, when you reach 1 bottle left, the word "bottles" becomes singular.
#
#Put a blank line between each verse of the song.


bottles = 99

while bottles > 0:
    if bottles > 1:
        print(str(bottles) + " bottles of beer on the wall, " + str(bottles) + " bottles of beer")
        bottles = bottles - 1
        if bottles != 1:
            print("Take one down and pass it around, " + str(bottles) + " bottles of beer on the wall")
        else:
            print("Take one down and pass it around, " + str(bottles) + " bottle of beer on the wall")
    else:
        print(str(bottles) + " bottle of beer on the wall, " + str(bottles) + " bottle of beer")
        bottles = bottles - 1
        print("Take one down and pass it around, " + str(bottles) + " bottles of beer on the wall")
    print("")
